# STATE.md — Project Memory

> **Last Updated**: 2026-02-28

## Current Position
- **Phase**: 1 — Project Setup & Firebase Foundation
- **Task**: Planning complete
- **Status**: Ready for execution

## Plans Created
- Plan 1.1: Flutter Project Scaffolding (wave 1) — 3 tasks
- Plan 1.2: Firebase Configuration & Auth Setup (wave 1) — 2 tasks
- Plan 1.3: Firestore Data Models & Seed Data (wave 2) — 2 tasks

## Key Decisions
- Flutter + Firebase stack
- Riverpod state management
- Flat Firestore collections
- Email/password auth (no forgot password)
- Direct to login (no splash/onboarding)
- Room data in Firestore (not hardcoded)
- propertyId in all models for future multi-property

## Next Steps
1. `/execute 1`

## Blockers
- Flutter SDK not installed on this machine
- Firebase project needs to be created in Firebase Console
